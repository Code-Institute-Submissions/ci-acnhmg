## UX

### User stories

As a user I want to navigate through the game UI and play the game

As a user I want to have fun

### Strategy

The main goal is for the user to be able to naviagte the game easily and for the user to have fun.

### Scope

The application guides the user through the rules and allows the user to play the game.

### Structure

The landing page features the logo, title and a input field for the user to input their name. Underneath the input field is a call to action button that leads the user to the next page - rules.

Rules page contains image of Tim Nook (lead character in the game and Nook Inc. owner) and a speach bubble through witch the user navigates by clicking or tapping the same call to aciton button.

After user goes through the rules, user is brought to the game screen that consists of the logo, timer, moves counter and 12 cards.

Once user completes level 1 in time call to action button appears which leads the user to level 2.

Once user completes level 2 in time call to action button appears which leads the user to level 3.

Once user completes level 3 in time, user is presented with a congratilations modal.
